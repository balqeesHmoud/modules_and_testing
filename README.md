## Lab-02: Modules, Testing, and Recursion

In this lab, I created a Python project to practice using modules, implementing functions for factorial computation (both iterative and recursive), and performing unit testing. The project structure included a `factorial_module` directory containing `factorial_module.py` with functions to compute factorial and a `test` directory with `test_factorial.py` for unit testing these functions. Additionally, a `clumsy` function was implemented for a more complex factorial computation using a specific sequence of mathematical operations. Unit tests were written to ensure the correctness of these functions.

The goal was to understand module usage, function implementation (both iterative and recursive), and the importance of testing for ensuring function correctness. This lab aimed to reinforce concepts related to Python modules, algorithm design, and testing methodologies.
